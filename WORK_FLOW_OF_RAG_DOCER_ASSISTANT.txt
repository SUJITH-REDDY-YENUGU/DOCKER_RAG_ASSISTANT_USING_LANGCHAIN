# Docker RAG Assistant Demo

This notebook explains the flow of our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
for answering questions about Docker documentation.  
All collected Docker docs are stored as `.txt` files inside the `notebooks/raw/` folder.

---

## Step 1: Load Docker Documentation

We collected Docker documentation pages from the official site and saved them as `.txt` files.
These files are read into memory and tagged with their filenames as metadata, so answers can cite sources.

---

## Step 2: Chunk Documents

The text files are split into smaller sections (chunks) of ~500 characters with overlap.
This makes retrieval more efficient and ensures context is preserved.

---

## Step 3: Create Embeddings

Each chunk is converted into a vector representation using the HuggingFace model
`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.  
These embeddings capture semantic meaning for better search.

---

## Step 4: Store in ChromaDB

The embeddings are stored in a ChromaDB vector database.  
This allows semantic search over the documentation.

---

## Step 5: Retrieval

When a user asks a question, the system searches ChromaDB for the most relevant chunks.
The retrieved chunks include both the text and the source filename.

---

## Step 6: Answer Generation

The retrieved chunks are passed to the Groq LLM (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`).
The model generates a clear answer, grounded in the retrieved documentation,
and cites the source `.txt` files.

## Example Q&A

**Q:** What is Docker volume?  
**A:** A Docker volume persists data outside the lifecycle of a container.  
It can be shared across containers and remains even when a container is removed.  
**Sources:** `docker_volume_overview.txt`, `docker_bind_mounts.txt`

---

**Q:** How does the VOLUME instruction in a Dockerfile work?  
**A:** The `VOLUME` instruction creates a mount point inside the container and marks it
for external volumes so data written there is persisted outside the container layer.  
**Sources:** `dockerfile_reference.txt`

## Conclusion

This flow demonstrates how the Docker RAG Assistant ingests documentation,
creates embeddings, stores them in ChromaDB, retrieves relevant chunks,
and generates answers with citations.
